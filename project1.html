             In this project, I write a simulation of a restaurant.The simulation has four sets of
			parameters - the number of eaters (diners) that wish to enter the restaurant, the times they
			approach the restaurant and what they order, the number of tables in the restaurant (there
			can only be as many eaters as there are tables at a time; other eaters must wait for a free
			table before placing their order), and the number of cooks in the kitchen that process orders.<br/>
			Eaters in the restaurant place their orders when they get seated. These orders are then handled
			by available cooks. Each cook handles one order at a time. A cook handles an order by using
			machines to cook the food items. To simplify the simulation, we make the following
			assumptions. There are only three types of food served by the restaurant - a Buckeye Burger,
			Brutus Fries, and Coke. Each person entering the restaurant occupies one table and orders one
			or more burgers, zero or more orders of fries, and zero or one glass of coke. The cook needs to
			use the burger machine for 5 minutes to prepare each burger, fries machine for 3 minutes for
			one order of fries, and the soda machine for 1 minute to fill a glass with coke. The cook can use
			at most one of these three machines at any given time. There is only one machine of each type
			in the restaurant (so, for example, over a 5-minute duration, only one burger can be prepared).
			Once the food (all items at the same time) are brought to a diner's table, they take exactly 30
			minutes to finish eating them, and then leave the restaurant, making the table available for
			another diner (immediately). <br/>
			<strong>Input:</strong>Diners arrive at the restaurant over a 120 minute duration, which is taken as input by
			the simulation. If there are N diners arriving, the input has N+3 lines, specifying, in order:
			number of diners (N), number of tables, number of cooks, and N other lines each with the
			following four numbers: a number between 0 and 120 stating when the diner arrived (this
			number is increasing across lines), the number of burgers ordered (1 or higher), number of
			order of fries (0 or higher), and whether or not coke was ordered (0 or 1).<br/>
            <strong>Implementation:</strong> I create one thread for each arriving diner, which
			will then compete for an available table. There will also be one thread for each cook, all of them
			active for the entire duration when the restaurant is open. Tables and machines for cooking the
			food are resources whose use must be coordinated among the threads.

	       	<img src="pics/unix.jpg" width="200" height="200" align="right">
	       	In this project, I designed a shell interface that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate process. A shell interface provides the user a prompt after which the next command is entered.<br/>
	       	Then I add a history feature into my UNIX Shell which will allow users to access up to fifteen most recently entered commands. These commands will be numbered starting at 1 and will continue to grow larger even past 15, e.g. if the user has entered 35 commands, the fifteen most recent commands should be numbered 21-35. The history commands will also be saved to a file when the shell is exited and input from the file the next time the shell is started.

	       	</h4>
	       	In this project, I design a programming solution to the bounded-buffer producer and consumer problem. The producer and consumer - running as separate threads - will move items to and from a buffer that is synchronized with <i>empty, full, and mutex </i>structures.

	       		</strong></a>
	       	</h4>
	       	In this project, I design programming solutions for matrix multiplication that take advantage of multiple threads executing in parallel.
